# JavaScript Basics - Task Overview

This project covers fundamental JavaScript concepts and basic programming tasks. It provides hands-on exercises to practice mathematical operations, logical comparisons, and user interaction using JavaScript.

## Overview

The tasks include:
1. Evaluating and understanding JavaScript expressions to observe their outputs.
2. Reading user input using `prompt()` and displaying outputs using `alert()`.
3. Performing arithmetic operations like addition, multiplication, and division.
4. Exploring JavaScript methods such as `Math.ceil()`, `Math.floor()`, and `Math.pow()`.

By completing these tasks, users will gain an essential understanding of JavaScript syntax and functionality.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: The primary language for implementing tasks and practicing basic operations.
- **HTML**: To provide a context for executing JavaScript code in a browser.

## Topics Covered

1. **Arithmetic Operators**: 
   - Multiplication, Division, Modulus
   - Examples: `5 % 3`, `7 / 2`

2. **String Concatenation**:
   - Combining strings with numbers.
   - Example: `"Hello" + 5`

3. **Logical Comparisons**:
   - Using equality (`===`), inequality (`!=`), and comparison operators (`<=`, `>=`).

4. **Math Object**:
   - Using built-in methods like:
     - `Math.ceil()` - Rounds up a number.
     - `Math.floor()` - Rounds down a number.
     - `Math.pow()` - Raises a number to a power.

5. **User Interaction**:
   - Using `prompt()` to take user input.
   - Using `alert()` to display results to the user.
